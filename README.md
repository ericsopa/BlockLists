# BlockLists

This is an extremely aggressive blocklist, it's too aggressive for most people to use. It will break a lot of websites, 
so if it annoys you to go in and whitelist individual domains or subdomains you should definitely not use this blocklist.

However if you do want to start to regain some of your privacy and halt the ever increasing flow of data and 
surveillance capitalism this blocklist will help you do it. 

If you want to understand how truly terrifying surveillance capitalism is I suggest reading
